# Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)

A `distributed`, `in-memory` `key–value` database,

## 1. pre knowledge

### NoSQL = Not Only SQL

 SQL support `ACID` (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
 
 NoSQL support `CAP` (Consistency, Availibility, Partition tolerance)
 
 There are no relations between NoSQL data, so it is very easy to extend it.
 
 
 
### Types of NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases fall into four main categories:

1. Key value Stores — Riak, Voldemort, and Redis

2. Wide Column Stores — Cassandra and HBase.

3. Document databases — MongoDB

4. Graph databases — Neo4J and HyperGraphDB.

### CAP (you can only select 2/3)

![CAP_Theorem](/images/CAP_Theorem.png)

#### For a distributed system, P must be selected

- CA: Relational database such as `Oracle`, `MySQL`
- CP: Choice of most large scaled Website such as Amazon, Taobao.
- AP: Redis, MongoDB


### BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency).

**Solution for the 2/3 selection of CAP: Lower the requirement of Consistency to satisfy basically Availibility**

- Basically Available: Guarantees the availability of the data . There will be a response to any request (can be failure too).

- Soft state: The state of the system could change over time.

- Eventual consistency: The system will eventually become consistent once it stops receiving input.


## 2. Intro to Redis

A `distributed`, `in-memory` `key–value` database

1. Support persistence
2. Not only `key-value` string, also support `list`, `set`, `zset`, `hash`
3. Support backup: `master-slave model`
